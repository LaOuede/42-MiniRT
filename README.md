<h1 align=center>MiniRT</h1>

<div align=center>
  
The <b>MiniRT</b> project is a mini ray tracing engine. It's an introduction to computer graphics concepts and ray tracing algorithms. It involves rendering 3D scenes by casting rays from the camera into the scene, calculating intersections with objects, and simulating lighting effects. Through this project, several concepts are learned such as ray-object intersections, shading models and fundamental techniques used in creating realistic computer-generated images.

<h3 align="left">What I've learned 📚</h3>

I've acquired a lot of basic knowledge on C programming :
- Ray Tracing Fundamentals
- Mathematics (vectors, matrices and trigonometry to perform ray-object intersection calculations)
- Computer Graphics Concepts
- Graphics Programming (MLX42)
- Testing and debugging

<h3 align="left">If I had to do it all over again 🗒</h3>

- I would change the way our scene objects are stored in the linked list to make them easier to use.
- I would add a GUI to provide users with controls for adjusting rendering settings, objects movement and parameters, camera angles, and scene parameters.

This project was a team effort with [Maxil Côté](https://github.com/Totoleader) ! 🚀


I couldn't have taken this project this far without him.
